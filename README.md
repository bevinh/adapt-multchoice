##Installation

This plugin has not been submitted to adapt's framework, so if you're interested in installing it at this stage, you'll have to download it and register it through your own adapt project.

##Usage

The idea behind this plugin is to have a multiple choice question that is not scored, yet the feedback is saved. This is ideal for projects in which for the learner there is a self-reflection piece, yet the creators of the learning objects want to understand what the learners select.
